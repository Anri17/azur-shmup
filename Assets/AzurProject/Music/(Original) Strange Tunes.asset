  composerComment: 'The OLD Main Menu theme.


    This was going to be the main
    menu theme, but I got better at making music so I replaced it.


    I am still
    going to keep it here. It is a gift.


    This is the very first track I ever
    finished, so I thought it would have been fitting to make it the main menu theme.'

# Main purpose of this project

Once a school project, this has a playground for me to learn various unity features.
As such, the original idea for this game has been shelved, for the time being at least. Maybe with luck I might work on it in the future.
For anyone interested, the last playable version of the game which I submited for as school project can be found in this repository: https://github.com/Anri17/shooter-pap
